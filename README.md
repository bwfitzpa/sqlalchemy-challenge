# sqlalchemy-challenge

The “SurfsUp” folder has the code for the assignment, when I used code from elsewhere this is noted in the comments of the code. For both parts of the assignment I used the starter code/notes provided. “climate_starter.ipynb” has the code for the first part of the assignment, and “app.py” has the code for the second part of the assignment.

The “SurfsUp” folder also has a resources folder which contains the data used in the assignment.
